The initial ring structure is:
Processor4 <---------- Processor1 ---------> Processor3
Processor5 <---------- Processor2 ---------> Processor4
Processor1 <---------- Processor3 ---------> Processor5
Processor2 <---------- Processor4 ---------> Processor1
Processor3 <---------- Processor5 ---------> Processor2

Sending message <<1>> from Processor1 to Processor4

^^^^^^ Swallowing the message <<1>> at Processor4 which is received from Processor1^^^^^^
Sending message <<2>> from Processor2 to Processor5

^^^^^^ Swallowing the message <<2>> at Processor5 which is received from Processor2^^^^^^
Sending message <<3>> from Processor3 to Processor1
The message received is <<3>> at Processor1 from Processor3

******The message <<3>> is greater than the ID of the current processor's ID:1******
Forwarding the message <<3>> from current processor Processor1 to the processor at left Processor4
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sending message <<3>> from Processor1 to Processor4

^^^^^^ Swallowing the message <<3>> at Processor4 which is received from Processor1^^^^^^
Sending message <<4>> from Processor4 to Processor2
The message received is <<4>> at Processor2 from Processor4

******The message <<4>> is greater than the ID of the current processor's ID:2******
Forwarding the message <<4>> from current processor Processor2 to the processor at left Processor5
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sending message <<4>> from Processor2 to Processor5

^^^^^^ Swallowing the message <<4>> at Processor5 which is received from Processor2^^^^^^
Sending message <<5>> from Processor5 to Processor3
The message received is <<5>> at Processor3 from Processor5

******The message <<5>> is greater than the ID of the current processor's ID:3******
Forwarding the message <<5>> from current processor Processor3 to the processor at left Processor1
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sending message <<5>> from Processor3 to Processor1
The message received is <<5>> at Processor1 from Processor3

******The message <<5>> is greater than the ID of the current processor's ID:1******
Forwarding the message <<5>> from current processor Processor1 to the processor at left Processor4
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sending message <<5>> from Processor1 to Processor4
The message received is <<5>> at Processor4 from Processor1

******The message <<5>> is greater than the ID of the current processor's ID:4******
Forwarding the message <<5>> from current processor Processor4 to the processor at left Processor2
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sending message <<5>> from Processor4 to Processor2
The message received is <<5>> at Processor2 from Processor4

******The message <<5>> is greater than the ID of the current processor's ID:2******
Forwarding the message <<5>> from current processor Processor2 to the processor at left Processor5
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sending message <<5>> from Processor2 to Processor5
Current processor:5 Message received: 5
!!!!!! Received own ID - Terminating as leader !!!!!!

The leader process is Processor5
