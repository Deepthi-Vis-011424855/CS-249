CONVERGECAST
------------------------------------------------------------------
Convergecast is an algorithm where information of all the nodes is
collected in the root of the tree. Here, the maximum value among 
all the nodes in the tree is sent to the root,

HOW TO RUN
------------------------------------------------------------------
This program is executed by running the Main.java class

FLOW OF EXECUTION
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The Main.java class object when created, it calls the init() 
method which creates the tree structure given.
2. A Convergecast() method is defined which recursively returns the
maximum value in each subtree, eventually returning the maximum 
element in the entire tree.
3. To collect all the values of all the nodes, an arraylist is 
created and a postorder traversal is done to store all the values 
in this arraylist.
